- **( BookChain )** The current mobile bookcrossing system generally has problems such as lack of trust, ineffective supervision, and low circulation efficiency, which have seriously affected the normal operation of bookcrossing. BookChain integrates bookcrossing activities with emerging blockchain technology, leverages the open, transparent, traceable, and decentralized characteristics of the blockchain to record the circulation information of books on the chain, so that participants can trace the historical circulation records of books, greatly reducing the possibility of losing books and rebuilding the trust in bookcrossing. The end-to-end bookcrossing replaces the bookshelf by using smart contract technology, the entire book circulation process does not require additional human involvement, which significantly improves the book circulation efficiency.

- **( AMVChain )** With the development of blockchain technology, modern electronic voting system leverages blockchain as underlying storage model to make the voting process more transparent, and guarantee immutability of data. However, the transparent characteristic may disclose sensitive information of candidate for all system users have the same right to their information. Besides that, the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain will lead to the disclosure of voters’ privacy and the third parties such as registration institutions involved in voting process also have possibility of tampering data. To overcome these difficulties, we apply authority management mechanism into blockchain-based voting systems. In this paper, we put forward AMVchain, a fully decentralized and efficient blockchain-based voting system. AMVchain has a three-layer access control architecture, and on each layer, smart contracts are responsible for validation and granting permissions. Linkable ring signature is adopted in the process of voting to protect ballot privacy. AMVchain also makes a tradeoff between efficiency and concurrency by introducing proxy nodes. The experiments results show that our system meets the basic requirements under the high concurrent users circumstance.
- **( LDV )** LDV is a lightweight DAG-based blockchain system designed for resource-constrained Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). LDV provides an effective data reduction approach, to be specific, nodes only need to store their relevant interested data, and the historical data can be pruned to reduce the data redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that LDV can save 97.13% storage space and has good scalability.
